# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION

# 1-Write a program that uses a variable to store a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

word = "conundrum"
puts word.upcase # Fixed from "word.upcase"

# I was not able to solve this from memory.
# Repetition is required to memorize ruby string commands ".upcase" rather than "capital".


# git add --all
# git commit -m "Add practice problem"
# git push origin main
